1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,263
Four hundred years after Tiber Septim's reign, 

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,253
the beginning will meet the end,

3
00:00:11,263 --> 00:00:15,391
and the bloody circle will close in the Empire of Tamriel.

4
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,472
The unworthy heirs of the Septim Dynasty

5
00:00:19,471 --> 00:00:23,735
have allowed the bonds of the Empire to weaken and crack. 

6
00:00:24,086 --> 00:00:28,482
Uriel Septim VII cannot repair what his ancestors ignored. 

7
00:00:28,483 --> 00:00:32,457
The provinces fight among themselves like neglected children, 

8
00:00:32,522 --> 00:00:36,798
drunk with rebellion, and one indomitable power hides itself,

9
00:00:36,799 --> 00:00:39,663
but not forever.
