1
00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:08,023
Excuse the gloom,

2
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:12,637
but none may know of this meeting.

3
00:00:13,753 --> 00:00:17,532
The nature of my trouble is darker still.

4
00:00:18,627 --> 00:00:21,764
Over a year ago, King Lysandus of Daggerfall

5
00:00:21,781 --> 00:00:26,013
died honorably on the field of battle.

6
00:00:26,121 --> 00:00:29,010
He was as loyal a subject,

7
00:00:29,183 --> 00:00:34,302
ally and friend... as you are.

8
00:00:35,694 --> 00:00:38,372
I did grieve for him,

9
00:00:39,304 --> 00:00:41,422
But his spirit does not rest.

10
00:00:42,572 --> 00:00:45,753
With the spectral army, he haunts his former kingdom,

11
00:00:45,818 --> 00:00:48,635
crying for revenge!

12
00:00:49,215 --> 00:00:54,849
I do not know why a good and loyal man would be so cursed.

13
00:00:56,316 --> 00:00:59,620
Perhaps you can find the answer

14
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:03,204
and close the marble jaws of Oblivion,

15
00:01:03,206 --> 00:01:06,201
bringing peace to his soul.

16
00:01:08,470 --> 00:01:11,839
I ask this as your Emperor

17
00:01:12,557 --> 00:01:15,286
and as your friend.

18
00:01:16,351 --> 00:01:20,758
I have one lesser request.

19
00:01:21,303 --> 00:01:23,647
Several years ago, I wrote a letter

20
00:01:23,684 --> 00:01:26,467
to the Queen of Daggerfall.

21
00:01:28,217 --> 00:01:31,346
It never arrived.

22
00:01:32,144 --> 00:01:34,783
The letter was of a sentimental and...

23
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:37,170
personal nature.

24
00:01:38,609 --> 00:01:42,403
If you find and destroy that letter,

25
00:01:42,433 --> 00:01:45,654
I will be grateful.

26
00:01:47,036 --> 00:01:48,852
Now my champion,

27
00:01:48,853 --> 00:01:50,723
rest well this night,

28
00:01:51,332 --> 00:01:54,401
for tomorrow you sail for the Kingdom

29
00:01:55,162 --> 00:01:57,602
of Daggerfall !
